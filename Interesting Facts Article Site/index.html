        <h2>Holy Crown of Hungary</h2>
        <p>The Holy Crown of Hungary (Hungarian: Szent Korona, Latin: Sacra Corona), also known as the Crown of Saint
          Stephen, named in honour of Saint Stephen I of Hungary, was the coronation crown used by the Kingdom of
          Hungary for most of its existence; kings were crowned with it since the twelfth century. The Crown symbolized
          the King's authority over the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (the Carpathian Basin), and it was a key mark of
          legitimacy. Through the history of Hungary, more than fifty kings were crowned with it, with the last being
          Charles IV in 1916. The only kings not so crowned were Wladyslaw I, John Sigismund Zápolya, and Joseph II.</p>

        <p>
          The enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in Constantinople
          in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas to the King Géza I of
          Hungary; both are depicted and named in the Greek language on enamel plaques in the lower crown. However, in
          popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older and of Papal provenance, dating to the time of the
          first King Stephen I of Hungary crowned 1000/1001. It is one of two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the
          other being the slightly earlier Monomachus Crown in the Hungarian National Museum, which may have had
          another function.

          <h3>Why is the Hungarian crown bent?</h3>
          <p>The cross was knocked crooked during the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of
            the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it
            properly. The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such.</p>
