        <h2>Holy Crown of Hungary</h2>
        <p>The Holy Crown of Hungary (Hungarian: Szent Korona, Latin: Sacra Corona), also known as the Crown of Saint
          Stephen, named in honour of Saint Stephen I of Hungary, was the coronation crown used by the Kingdom of
          Hungary for most of its existence; kings were crowned with it since the twelfth century. The Crown symbolized
          the King's authority over the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (the Carpathian Basin), and it was a key mark of
          legitimacy. Through the history of Hungary, more than fifty kings were crowned with it, with the last being
          Charles IV in 1916. The only kings not so crowned were Wladyslaw I, John Sigismund Zápolya, and Joseph II.</p>

        <p>
          The enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in Constantinople
          in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas to the King Géza I of
          Hungary; both are depicted and named in the Greek language on enamel plaques in the lower crown. However, in
          popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older and of Papal provenance, dating to the time of the
          first King Stephen I of Hungary crowned 1000/1001. It is one of two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the
          other being the slightly earlier Monomachus Crown in the Hungarian National Museum, which may have had
          another function.

          <h3>Why is the Hungarian Crown Bent?</h3>
          <p>The cross was knocked crooked during the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of
            the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it
            properly. The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such.</p>

        <h2>Crown of Charlemagne</h2>
        <p>The Crown of Charlemagne (French: Couronne de Charlemagne) was a name given to the ancient coronation crown
          of Kings of the Franks, and later Kings of France after 1237.</p>

        <p>
          It was probably created as a simple circlet of four curved rectangular jewelled plates for Charles the Bald,
          the grandson of Charlemagne, but later, four large jewelled fleur-de-lis were added to these four original
          plates, probably by Philip Augustus around 1180 and surmounted by a cap decorated with precious stones. At
          this time a similar but open crown, the one of the queen, existed too. One of them was melted down in 1590 by
          the Catholic League during the siege of Paris. The remaining crown was used up to the reign of King Louis XVI,
          who was crowned in 1775 in the Reims Cathedral. The crown of Joan of Évreux was then used for the coronation
          of the queens.

        <h2>St Edward's Crown</h2>
        <p>
          St Edward's Crown is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. Named after Saint Edward the
          Confessor, versions of it have traditionally been used to crown English and British monarchs at their
          coronations since the 13th century.
        </p>

        <p>
          The current St Edward's Crown was made for Charles II in 1661. It is 22-carat gold, 30 centimetres (12 in)
          tall, weighs 2.23 kilograms (4.9 lb), and is decorated with 444 precious and fine gemstones. The crown is
          similar in weight and overall appearance to the original, but its arches are Baroque.
        </p>

        <p>
          After 1689, owing to its weight the crown was not used to crown any monarch for over 200 years. In 1911, the tradition was revived by George V and has continued ever since, including at the 2023 coronation of Charles III and Camilla. In 1953, Elizabeth II opted for a stylised image of this crown to be used on coats of arms and other insignia in Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority.

          <h3>The Original Crown</h3>
          <p>
            The original crown was a holy relic kept at Westminster Abbey, Edward's burial place, until the regalia were
            either sold or melted down when Parliament abolished the monarchy in 1649, during the English Civil War.

          <h3>Earliest Crown</h3>
          <p>The earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in Deal, Kent, and
            dates to between 200 and 150 BCE. A sword, brooch, ceremonial shield, and decorated bronze crown with a
            single arch,[d] which sat directly on the head of its wearer, were found inside the tomb of the Mill Hill
            Warrior.</p>
